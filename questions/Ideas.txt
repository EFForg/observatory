- IP signing issuers, RFC 1918 IP signing Issuers & their roots
- # of issuers signed per Root CAs
- Analysis of RSA key modulus
	- population - are they chosen at random
	- are any modulus' prime (i.e. not keys!)
	- funny parameters
- Unqualified name signing issuers
- Key reuse by CAs
	- why
	- how does this extend key usage
	- when key usage is extended, will old signatures still work
	- CA keys vs. subordinate keys
	 - are CA keys exposed like subordinate keys!?!
	- how
- Issuers by country
- Leaves by issuer
- Leaves by root
- Government CAs
- Self signed attacks by Subject alternate names
- Widely used non-standard CAs
- weakest certs
- oldest certs
- weirdest certs
	- most names
	- longest subject
	- funniest characters
	- weirdest attributes
- What certs have funny chars / nulls / non-standard bytes
- Are their any non-minimal UTF-8 encodings in valid certs
What would attacks look like
- from one country - signing another
- from 'government' signing commercial or other names
- from companies - signing other companies
