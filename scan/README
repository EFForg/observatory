Checkout a copy of this for each portion of the code.

Set MYHOST in ControlScript.py in each of those to tell it which portion of
the scan it's doing.  Then run ControlScript (we use "nohup" for that).

If you wish to resume an interupted scanner, or start a new one at some offset
inside a portion (sometimes desirable in response to /8s that are sparsely
populated and therefore take a LONG time to scan), you can edit the "startpos"
file in that checkout.

cs2.py is like ControlScript but scans a much smaller number of /8s that have
been allocated in the recent past.
