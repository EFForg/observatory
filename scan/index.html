  <p>This is a scanning system for the <a href="https://www.eff.org">Electronic 
  Frontier Foundation</a>'s <a href="https://www.eff.org/observatory">SSL
  Observatory project</a>.  This project works to improve the security of
  HTTPS/TLS/SSL services on the Web by collecting and auditing the
  certificates on publicly-visible HTTPS servers.  EFF works with web browser
  manufacturers and Certificate Authorities to fix the problems the
  Observatory finds.  You may notice brief connections from this host to port
  443 on your machines with public IPv4 addresses as we collect this data.</p>

  <p>If you have read the <a href="https://www.eff.org/observatory">project
  page</a> but have further questions about this machine, feel free to contact
  us at <tt>ssl-survey@eff.org</tt>.</p>
